3. Maybe it can be an explore page or maybe on the home page (under the tabs). It can say Events and underneath it can feature the events that we have already had, upcoming events, and when we travel out of the country. If this works I have the verbiage. Or do you think this would work better as it's own tab, so when they click on it pictures come up?
           Also, will the podcast go here as well?
5. We can use the pictures that we sent you.
          We would like to add a service: Treatment Plans (I will send over verbiage)
          Under Magnet Water and Lhamo Pads we would like to add that shipping is available or to the shop area. Whichever is best
7. Can their be a place where people can book us to come speak, invite us to health fairs, and host health parties?
